**Davron Ochilov**: This assignment greatly developed my abilities in web design, I was able to create a wireframe with a proper layout, flow and functionality. With my partner's insights I created a wireframe on pen and paper with many different components that I thought were neccesarry for the creation of the website. We went over the term project requirements and made sure our website would fit most of the future criteria. 

**Mehruj Kamal**:  During this project I practically learned what wireframing is and how sitemap should be constructed based on the design layout. I learned how wireframes and sitemaps should be constructed for a better architecture of a website we have in mind and how to efficiently clarify the website features so that it is more responsive and user friendly. I worked alongside my project partner to plan and design the wireframe of the website. I also created the sitemap with the help of my partner’s perception. 

Purpose of the chalkboard website is for teachers to add courses and maintain the roster, instructor list and course contents. The students can access all the materials, attempt assignments, get their grades and contact info of the instructors.

Features: 
On the homepage the website asks for either login/signup depending on whether the user is an instructor/ student. After signup the website will ask to sign in. 
Student View: 
Students get directed towards their current and old courses. They have the ability to search up a course and add it for approval. 
If they are already approved in a course upon clicking on the course they can access the navigation bar.On the navigation they can access overview, announcements by the instructor, course materials, recordings and instructor contact info. They can view all the assignments due and attempt them. After clicking on a particular assignment they can add answers and attach files. They can submit or save a draft.

Instructors can go to the class roster and approve students.On the navigation they can access overview, add and remove course materials, recordings and even add new instructors, remove them or leave by themselves .
